inspired prophets delivered
their predictions and labored
to reform their countrymen3
there the gospel of Jesus Christ
was first preached3 and there
the long-expected Messiah fi-
nished the work of man’s sal-
vation by dying on the cross.
To punish the Jews for their
impiety and wickedness, their
city was often given up for a
period into the hands of their
enemies, but it was not wholly
destroyed, till they had filled up
the measure of their iniquities
by crucifying the Son of God.
After a long and miserable siege
it was taken by Titus, on the
eighth of September, A. D. 70,
and made a heap of ruins.
About sixty years* after its de-
struction, a small city was built
on its site, which, after having
been in the possession of many
different masters, is now under

the power of the Ottoman
Turks.
