Persas, the Persians, the in-
habitants of Persia, a celebrated
kingdom of'Asia, which in its
ancient state extended to Me-
dia on the north, to the Persian
gulph on the south, to Cara·
mania on the east, and to Su-
siana on the west. About 559
years before the Christian aera,
the Persian empire was founded
by Cyrus the Great, on the
ruins of the empire of the
Medes, and it soon included in
its dominions all the countries
between the Hellespont and the
Indus, and between Arabia and
Pontus. Its glory was however
but of short duration. About
A. C. 331, Alexander the Great
totally subdued it, and it re-
mained sor 500 years subject to
the power of the Greeks and
Parthians. Persia was again
erected into a kingdom, Α. D.
229, by Artaxerxe, a common
soldier, and continued an inde-
pendent and extensive empire
till about A. D. 660, when it

was finally conquered by the
Saracens. The Persians were
remarkable principally for their
warlike spirit, sor their ability
to bear the excessivo toils and
labor-s of a military life, sor
their love of splendor, and for
their superstition. 'l'hey wor-
shipped as deities the sun, moon,
and starS, and even offered sa-
crifices to fire. Persepolis or,
as its magnificent ruins are
now called, Estakar orTehelmi-
