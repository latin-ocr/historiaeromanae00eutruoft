SCHOOL AND COLLEGE GREEK CLASSICS„
wrrH ENGLISH NOTES, QUESTJONS„ ἃς.

At the express desire of many eminent Sclmolmasters, Mr. VALPY
lias commenced the publication of a SERIES of such portions of the
GREEK AUTH‘ORS as are chiefly read in the upper Classes of Schools
and in Colleges. The best Texts are adopted, and the Carmen and. ,
EXPLANATORY Nores are presented, it is presumed‚ in a more inviting ᾗ
and accessible form than those of Latin Commentators, by a'voiding that “⁵³
profuseness of annotation which frequently anticipates the iugenuhy, su-
persedes the industry, and re=ards rather than promotes the improvement
§of the pupil. ExAmrxAnox Qunsrloxs, adapted to the points discussed
in the Notes‚ and Ixonxm, are also added 3 and the Series, it is hoped,
will constitute a convenient introduction to the niceties and elegancies of
Greek Literature‚ and to tlte perusal of that portion of tlne relies of an-
tiquity which is best calculated to interest a youtllful mind.
Each volume will be sold separately; and it is intended that all shall
be publislted in a cheap duodecimo form. .,
The followmg are ready for delivery : ὲ
