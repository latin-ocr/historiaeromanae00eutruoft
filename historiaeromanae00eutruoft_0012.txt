Remo, RemuS. The Roman
historians relate that Romulus
and Remus were thrown‚ as
soon as they were born, into the
river Tiber; but being cast on
shore by the waves‚ their lives
were preserved by a she-wolf,
who fed thern with her milk,
till they were discovered by
Faustulus, a shepherd‚who took
them under his care, and
brought them up as his own
sons. A part of this account is
however generally considered
fabulous. The name of the
shepherd’s wife, by whom the
two sons of Ilia were brought
up, is said to have been Lupa,
and from this name the tradi-
tion oftheir having been nou·
rished by a she-wolf appears to
have arisen. Remus was slain
by his brother Romulus in a.
dispute, which arose between
them soon after the foundation
of Rome was laid.

celebrated in honor of Jupiter
Olympius at the expiration of

Olympiad. As the computa-

been about A. C. 753.
